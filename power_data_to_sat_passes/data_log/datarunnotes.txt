phase2 includes 2 good runs of zenith data with the added attenuation I put in in April at Green Bank, after Pat put it the replacement beamformer

phase3 is the data taken after Rich installed his new DAQ system, the old one had a crashing problem
 - zenith
	should be discarded, one of the TLE files had an error
 - zenith2
	data mostly looks good
