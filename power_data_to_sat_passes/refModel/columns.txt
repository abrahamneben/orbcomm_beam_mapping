   The data are give with 1 degree resolution.  The columns are as follows:

Theta [deg.]    - theta coordinate of direction
Phi [deg.]     - phi coordinate of direction
Dir.Abs [dBi  ]    - response from SQRT(Eth^2 + Ephi^2) in given direction
Dir.Th [dBi  ]    - response to linear pol (Eth) in given direction
Dir.Ph [dBi  ]    - response to linear pol (Ephi) in given direction
Left [dBi  ]     - response to left-hand circular in given direction
Right [dBi  ] - response to right-hand circular in given direction
