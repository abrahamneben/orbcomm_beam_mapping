PREDICT is Copyright 1991-2003 by John A. Magliacane, KD2BD.

Algorithms used in PREDICT to calculate the positions of satellites
in earth orbit as well as the position of the sun are based on Pascal
routines written by Dr. TS Kelso and ported to 'C' by Neoklis Kyriazis,
5B4AZ.  The algorithm used to calculate the position on the moon was
obtained from the "Amateur Radio Software", by John Morris, GM4ANB,
published by the Radio Society of Great Britian in 1985.

Socket-based server code as well as the "map" client application
was contributed by Ivan Galysh, KD4HBO.

PIC/TRACK antenna rotator control code was contributed by Vittorio
Benvenuti, I3VFJ.

The "gsat" client was contributed by Xavier Crehueras, EB3CZS.

The Perl client demonstration program was contributed by Rich
Parry, W9IF.

The WinPredictClient was contributed by Steve Fraser, VK5ASF.

The concept of using "xearth" as a graphical display for PREDICT
was originally conceived by Wade Hampton (which later developed
into "earthtrack").

Many have contributed smaller amounts of code to the project,
including Bent Bagger OZ6BL, Tom Busch WB8WOR, Steve Fraser VK5ASF,
Xavier Crehueras, EB3CZS, and others. 

Calculations for squint angle were adopted from trk-0.4.1 by Lapo
Pieri, IK5NAX.

Special thanks go to Linus Torvalds and a world-wide cast of open source
programmers who have contributed their time and talent in making the
Linux operating system a truly outstanding product and the fastest
growing operating system on the planet!
