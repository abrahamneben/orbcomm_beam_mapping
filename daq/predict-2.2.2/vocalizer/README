PREDICT's "vocalizer" utility and associated files are contained within
this directory.  Under the direction of PREDICT, selected audio samples
from this directory are played through the system's soundcard at specific
intervals during the duration of a satellite pass.

The "vocalizer" utility will read WAV files containing uncompressed
PCM data, provided the bit rate and word size is supported by your
soundcard.

The voice samples in this directory were obtained
via AT&T's voice synthesis demonstration web site
(http://www.research.att.com/projects/tts/demo.html), and
are used in this application under permission granted by AT&T:

I believe that you are ok, as long as no money is being made.
